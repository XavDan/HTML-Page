  <p>This page will talk about the video games I like to play and how I will categorize them.</p>

   <dt><a href="rpg.html">RPG</a></dt>
   <dd>Role-Playing Games have you play as a character that you progress and develope through a story.</dd>
   <dt><a href="fps.html">FPS</a></dt>
   <dd>First-Person Shooters have you shoot stuff. There is generally very little character developement,
       but sometimes gear progression.</dd>

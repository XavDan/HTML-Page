  <h1>Video Game Taxonomy: FPS</h1>
  <p>FPS games have a special place in my heart for being the first kind of game I've ever played. Although the story is generally bland, the gameplay is fun.</p>

   <dd>Overwatch is an FPS with many different characters, all with different abilities and play style. It features some standard FPS gamemodes such as 
       point control and guarding an objective.</dd>
   <dt><a href="callofduty.html">Call Of Duty</a></dt>
   <dd>The Call Of Duty franchise is your generic FPS. You run around and shoot stuff. It's not a favorite of mine, but I couldn't really think of any
       other FPS off the top of my head.</dd>

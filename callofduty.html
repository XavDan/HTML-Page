  <h1>Video Game Taxonomy: Call of Duty</h1>
  <p>There isn't all too much to say about the Call of Duty franchise. You play as a soldier in various time periods shooting through your standard FPS 
     game modes, including team deathmatch, capture the flag, and control the point. The story line is good, but online play, which is the bulk of the
	 game, leaves little to creativity.</p>

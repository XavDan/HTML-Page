  <h1>Video Game Taxonomy: Overwatch</h1>
  <p>Overwatch is a relatively new game, but has already won IGN's Game Of The Year award. In Overwatch, you play as a group of heroes who were blamed for
     the damages caused when fighting robots in an incident called the Omnic Crisis, where robotic beings rose up and attempted to destroy humanity. There
	 is no standard story mode, only multiplayer game modes, along with bots and training courses. The game modes include escorting an objective, capturing 
	 and defending points, along with arcade modes with differnt roles and missions.</p>
